My second project on GitHub

This project was the second bigger learning task in my studies at Karelia University of Applied Sciences. The user interface programming course was using Scene Builder and JavaFX. But I wanted to learn something about the using React Native-librarys. In this project I got help from my sister especially basics of React Native-librarys and using database of Firebase.
